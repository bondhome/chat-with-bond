# Chat with Bond


Chat with Bond is an open-source web application that connects with Bond servers and ChatGPT. Optionally, you can use ElevenLabs to give the assistant a realistic human voice.

You can [self-host with Docker](#running-on-your-own-computer).

Powered by the new ChatGPT API from OpenAI, this app was forked from Chat with GPT by cogentapps. It is developed using TypeScript + React. We welcome pull requests from the Bond community!
